<p>Since the first publication of the digital edition we were managing the design process and were responsible for HTML5 developments. We supported the whole produtcion process, including app and enterprise feature development. The german <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/rolling-stone/id459438953?mt=8&affId=1857076&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Rolling Stone for iPad</a> is filled with a lot of interactive and process improving features built with HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript. A configurable <strong>iOS-optimized 3D coverflow</strong> as index for music reviews is used. <strong>iTunes audio samples</strong> are streamed into every article and the <strong>hardest music quiz</strong> of germany including a contest server was developed by Geil,Danke! <a href='http://www.axel-springer-mediahouse-berlin.de/'>Axel Springer</a> used <a href='https://portier.geildanke.com/#/'>Portier</a> as an entitlement server to distribute single issues to advertisers. A custom push notification service is integrated into the App.</p>

<p>Since the first days we are <strong>improving the development workflow</strong> and adapring InDesign templates regularly. As soon as the finished print layouts and contents arrive at Geil,Danke! we have a period of about <strong>10-12 days</strong> to complete the whole edition â€“ sometimes more than 170 pages with additional special content.</p>
