headline: Platform-agnostic apps
lead: Stable, accessible and performant apps – Your users are on various operating systems. It is quick to exclude users and customers. To prevent this, we bet on cross-platform apps, web technologies and hybrid apps.
teaser: With the combination of HTML5 and native code, a comprehensive UX design process and test-driven development we do everything to make our apps accessible and widely used. We focus on semantic markup, high performance, responsiveness plus reliable and maintainable code.
