teaser: New CSS for existing HTML markup
description: For the redesign of musikexpress.de Axel Springer was looking for experienced Stylesheet developers, as it was impossible to regenerate the markup for the whole page. Even though we are professionals for responsive design, we were asked to develop a pixel-perfect Stylesheet without changing one line of markup code.
