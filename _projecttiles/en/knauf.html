title: Knauf Infothek
teaser: Custom Storefront With Search For Booklets and Technical Documents
description: We develop and support the Infothek für iPad and Android together with IRS Integrated Realization Services. Users may search or filter to find technical documentation and brochuers of Knauf products. We developed the app using test-driven design and components in AngularJS – making it easy to maintain. The backend is based on Adobe Digital Publishing Suite and is provided by IRS.
