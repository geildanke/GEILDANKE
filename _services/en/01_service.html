column-1: <span class="typo-bold">Reliability</span> and <span class="typo-bold">high quality</span> are our most important goals. That's why we work with clearly defined processes, not only when we work with code. Every potential client or partner receives a <span class="typo-bold">detailed offer</span> and an order confirmation before the project starts. We always work <span class="typo-bold">agile</span> â€“ sprint-based with Scrum or with various releases with Kanban. Besides that we care about <span class="typo-bold">privacy</span> and data security.
column-2: Nobody's perfect. That's why we established a <span class="typo-bold">continous improvement process</span>, so we can build on our experiences and improve the <span class="typo-bold">quality of our work constantly</span>. Our method reflects in our general terms and conditions, The Geil,Danke! Reliability Manifesto. You can read the Manifesto <a href="">here</a>.
