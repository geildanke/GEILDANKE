column-1: Our high expectations in <span class="typo-bold">reliability</span> and quality are reflected in our development process. We focus on <span class="typo-bold">maintainability</span> to allow a project to grow. We emphasize clean code, clearly defined <span class="typo-bold">code-conventions</span> and a good documenation.
column-2: We work with <span class="typo-bold">established build and deployment processes</span>, <span class="typo-bold">test-driven development</span> and <span class="typo-bold">contiuous integration</span>. We fix bugs before implementing new features. And we foster data and code cleansing methods.
